  ## Description
  Australia is home to over 100 species of animals, insects, and sealife that can and probably want to kill you. According to the National Coronial Information System of Australia (ncis.org.au), these deadly predators kill an average of 32 people per year. ToDieInAustralia is an app to share about your well founded fear of being killed by something in Australia. Both educational and morbidly humorous, ToDieInAustralia lets users create an account, post about a killer critter, add a photo of said critter, and comment on other users posts. The posts are saved to the user's dashboard, and by going to the home page users can view a feed of other user's posts.  

  ToDieInAustralia uses javascript, node.js, express.js, MySQL, handlebars.js, and AWS

  ## Installation
